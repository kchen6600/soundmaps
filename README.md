- Sources for Visual Aspects: http://paperjs.org/
- Sources for Sound Aspects: https://tonejs.github.io/build/Tone.js

To run:
1. git clone the repo

Generating sounds:
- Keys ASDFJKL; (where the fingers normally rest on a keyboard) map to the C4-C5 ionian scale triads
- Keys QWERUIOP (the 8 keys above where the fingers normally rest) map to the C4-C5 phrygian scale notes
- Key 1 toggles on / off the distortion effect, key 2 toggles on / off the vibrato effect

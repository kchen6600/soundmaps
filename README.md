# soundMaps

GENED 1080 Final Project
- Sources for Visual Aspects: http://paperjs.org/
- Sources for Sound Aspects: https://tonejs.github.io/build/Tone.js

To run:
1. git clone the repo
2. Open canvas.html in Chrome or another browser
3. Create a sound map!

Generating sounds:
- Keys ASDFJKL; (where the fingers normally rest on a keyboard) map to the C4-C5 ionian scale triads
- Keys QWERUIOP (the 8 keys above where the fingers normally rest) map to the C4-C5 phrygian scale notes
- Key 1 toggles on / off the distortion effect, key 2 toggles on / off the vibrato effect

Generating visuals:
- Keys ASDFJKL; (where the fingers normally rest on a keyboard) map to either sine waves, squares, or circles of various colors
- Keys QWERUIOP (the 8 keys above where the fingers normally rest) map to rectangles of various colors
- Key 1 (which also toggles the distortion effect) toggles on / off the smoothing effect of sine waves
